* For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
* Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://imgur.com/) but feel free to use anything you want).
