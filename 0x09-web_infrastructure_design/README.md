## Learning Objectives
### General

* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements
### General

* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
* Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://imgur.com/) but feel free to use anything you want).
